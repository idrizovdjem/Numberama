# Numberama

## Introduction
Numberama is simple number matching game. The objective is to match pair of same digits or pair of two digits that sum to 10. Valid pair is every two digits that are side by syde horizontaly or vertiacly. When pair is matched, it's transformed to red crosses. Red crosses are holes that are not counted as digits, so if we have digits separated by crosses they actually make pair. Main objective is to make as much pairs as you can for 3 minutes!
